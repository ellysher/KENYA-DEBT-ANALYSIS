The objectives of this project are:
Visualize Kenya's public debt trend over time using line charts to identify patterns and fluctuations.
Compare the growth rate of public debt with the GDP growth rate to assess the sustainability of debt.
Calculate the debt-to-GDP ratio to understand the country's debt burden and monitor its changes over time.
Analyze the composition of public debt (e.g., domestic vs. external debt) to identify potential risks and dependencies.
Investigate the interest payments on public debt to understand their impact on the country's fiscal budget.
Assess the debt maturity profile to evaluate refinancing risks and potential vulnerabilities.
